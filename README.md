### Entity-Component-System (ECS)

[Entity-Component-System](https://github.com/ozzysmithjones/entity-component-system)

An Entity-Component-System is a data-orientated approach for representing entities within games. The idea is to structure entities in a way to mitigate cache misses, which is a common source of performance problems within games. Inspired by this idea, I made my own ECS library to use in my game engine projects. This library uses C++ variadic templates to provide a flexible API and it uses `if constexpr` to further filter candidate items at *compile-time*. It is designed for projects with high-performance requirements and object counts, like Real-Time-Strategy games. 

This project was inspired by Unity DOTS, which has an ECS system: [Unity Dots](https://unity.com/dots). Also I was inspired by the Entt library, which is currently used commercially in Minecraft and many other projects: [Entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) 

### Vulkan Renderer

Vulkan is an API used to interface directly with the GPU on a computer. Recently I developed a project that renders a 3D model directly to the screen using only the Vulkan SDK and the GLFW library. Game engines often depend upon an API such as Vulkan to present 3D models to the screen, so learning this tech is very handy for future game engine projects. 

### Chess AI

Sometimes your programming journey takes you to a rabbit hole, one such rabbit hole is chess AI. During my time at University, I made a chess AI that can beat a 1600 rated opponent. At the time this AI was much better at playing chess than I was. There's many AI techniques used in this project to filter inadequate moves and make predictions of better moves from previous moves. 

### Tower Defence Genetic Algorithm

[Tower Defence Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/ozzysmithjones/GeneticAlgorithm)

A genetic algorithm is the technique of using theories of evolution to develop an AI gradually over time. This partivular genetic algorithm finds the optimal sequence of towers to place in a tower defence game, their locations and the order that the towers should be placed in. This is an old project but might be interesting never the less.
