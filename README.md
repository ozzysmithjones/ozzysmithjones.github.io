### Native Platform Layer
Platform layer library. This library allows provides to native utilities provided by the operating system such as threading, windowing, file mapping and memory management. It is designed to support cross-platform in the future but right now it just supports windows.

### Vulkan Renderer

Vulkan is an API used to interface directly with the GPU on a computer. Recently I developed a project that renders a 3D model directly to the screen using only the Vulkan SDK and the GLFW library. Game engines often depend upon an API such as Vulkan to present 3D models to the screen, so learning this tech is very handy for future game engine projects.

### Tower Defence Genetic Algorithm

[Tower Defence Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/ozzysmithjones/GeneticAlgorithm)

A genetic algorithm is the technique of using theories of evolution to develop an AI gradually over time. This partivular genetic algorithm finds the optimal sequence of towers to place in a tower defence game, their locations and the order that the towers should be placed in. This is an old project but might be interesting never the less.
